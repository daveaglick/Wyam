            <p><i>Posted on Tuesday, March 14, 2017</i></p>
            <p>Doyle is often referred to as "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle" or simply "Conan Doyle" (implying that Conan is part of a compound surname, as opposed to his given middle name). His baptism entry in the register of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, gives "Arthur Ignatius Conan" as his given names and "Doyle" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather. The cataloguers of the British Library and the Library of Congress treat "Doyle" alone as his surname.</p>

In disguise, Holmes witnesses Adler marry the man she truly loves, then by means of an elaborate stratagem discovers the photograph&#x27;s hiding place. But when Holmes and the king return to retrieve the photo, they find Adler has fled the country with it, leaving behind a letter for Holmes and a portrait of herself for the King. The king allows Holmes to retain the portrait as a souvenir.&#xA;</p>

                                    <p>Inspector Lestrade asks for Holmes&#x27;s help after Charles McCarthy is murdered, and his son, James, is implicated. McCarthy, and another local landowner, John Turner, are both Australian expatriates, and Lestrade was originally engaged by Turner&#x27;s daughter, Alice, who believes James is innocent. Holmes interviews James, and then inspects the scene of the murder, deducing a third man was present. Realising Holmes has solved the case, Turner confesses to the crime, revealing that McCarthy was blackmailing him due to Turner&#x27;s criminal past. Holmes does not reveal the crime, but secures James&#x27;s release because of the presence of a third person at the crime scene.&#xA;</p>

                                <p>Jabez Wilson, a pawnbroker, consults Holmes about a job he gained only because of his red hair. The job took him away from his shop for a short period each afternoon, and involved him copying the Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica. After eight weeks, he was informed that the job had suddenly finished. Holmes visits the pawnbroker&#x27;s shop, and after some investigation contacts a police inspector and the manager of a nearby bank. Along with Watson, they hide in the bank vault, and catch two thieves, who had dug a tunnel from the shop during the hours that Wilson was out each afternoon.&#xA;</p>

                                    <p>John Openshaw tells Holmes about two strange deaths in his family. In 1883, his uncle died two months after receiving a letter from India, inscribed &quot;K.K.K.&quot; with five orange pips enclosed. In 1885, Openshaw&#x27;s father received a similar letter, and died three days afterwards. Openshaw recently received a similar letter and asks for advice. Holmes tells Openshaw to do as the letter asks and leave a diary page, which Holmes deduces is connected to the Ku Klux Klan, on the garden sundial. Openshaw is killed before he can do so, but Holmes discovers the killers have been travelling on a sailing ship, and sends the captain a letter with five orange pips. The ship is lost at sea.&#xA;</p>

                                <p>Against the wishes of her stepfather, Miss Mary Sutherland has become engaged to Hosmer Angel. On the morning of their wedding Hosmer elicits a promise that Mary will remain faithful to him &quot;even if something quite unforeseen&quot; occurs, then mysteriously disappears on the way to the church. Holmes deduces that Hosmer was Mary&#x27;s stepfather in disguise, the charade a bid to condemn his stepdaughter to spinsterhood and ensure his continued access to her inheritance. Holmes does not reveal the truth to Mary because &quot;There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman&quot;; he had already advised her to put the matter behind her, though she responded that Hosmer &quot;shall find me ready when he comes back.&quot;&#xA;</p>
